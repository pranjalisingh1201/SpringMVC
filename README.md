# SpringMVC
 It does not have a front controller - Dispatcher Servlet to map the request, Also it does not have an application.properties file so we have to do all the configurations manually in the web.xml file.

1) Set up Spring MVC Project with Tomcat Server. Add Server as server and as a library. Run the Maven project on the server.
